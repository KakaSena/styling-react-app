# Styling React App

This Demo app explain various ways to style a React application. It's designed as a practical reference for learning and experimenting with different styling approaches—from traditional CSS to modern solutions like CSS-in-JS.

## 📚 Based On

This project is based on the course **[React – The Complete Guide (2025 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)** by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**. The course has been an incredible resource for learning both the fundamentals and advanced features of React.

## 🔍 What I'm Learning

This project focuses on the following React styling concepts:

- **Styling with vanilla CSS** – Applying global styles using plain `.css` files.
- **Scoping styles with CSS Modules** – Writing modular and component-scoped styles to avoid conflicts.
- **CSS-in-JS styling with Styled Components** – Using the `styled-components` library to write CSS directly in JavaScript.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS** – Utilizing utility-first classes to rapidly build modern UIs.
- **Static & Dynamic (conditional) styling** – Applying styles based on component props, state, or conditions at runtime.
